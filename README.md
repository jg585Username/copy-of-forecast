**The best forecast website for BC ski/board!**

### [- Website -](https://skibc.tech/)


## Description

An easy-to-use snow forecast website for ski/board in British Columbia with modern UI.
<br>
<br>

Forecast data is from snow-forecast.com, which I find to be the most accurate forecast. Let me know if there is a better forecast.

## Notes: 

- Saves the resorts you select
- Forecast snow and temperature are conservative
- Tends to underestimate interior mountains and overestimate coastal mountains
